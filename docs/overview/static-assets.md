# How to include static assets

In order to include things like images, fonts, style sheets, downloadable 
files, or JavaScript in the final build they must be included in a _static_ 
folder. 

This folder will mirror the root of the project during build. For example if 
in the final build you want an image located at /images/diagrams/1.png you
would place it at _project_root_/static/images/diagrams/1.png.

## Default static assets 

The following assets are included automatically:

- Bootstrap CSS & JavaScript
- CSS, JavaScript, and font file for a small selection of FontAwesome icons
- A custom CSS file for article styling 
- A font file for the Overpass font
